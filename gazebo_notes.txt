robot ground truth pose:
subscribe to /gazebo/link_states
msg.name[i] = mobile_base::base_footprint
pose = msg.pose[i]

or:
rosservice call /gazebo/get_link_state "link_name: 'base_footprint'
reference_frame: ''" 
pose = response.pose


camera ground truth pose:
subscribe to ~/user_camera/pose
Problem: that is a private topic...


Spawning in my camera:
rosrun gazebo_ros spawn_model -file `rospack find pips_visualization`/data/camera_model.sdf -sdf -model camera6 -x 6 -y -3.54 -z .5

should also be able to use the srdf service; look at spawn_model script.

moving camera:
rosservice call /gazebo/set_link_state "link_state:
  link_name: 'camera6::camera_link'
  pose:...
   reference_frame: 'mobile_base::base_footprint'" 
   
   
Plan: get viewpoint wrt robot base in rviz and set the rviz_camera to have the same pose,
